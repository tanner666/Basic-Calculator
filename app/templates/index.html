                This website was created for a project in my IS-218 class. It features a calculator, a results page, a results log page,
                and some extra information I found valuable while developing this project, including, object-oriented programming principles and terms,
                AAA testing, and some pylint tips.
                The main feature is the calculator page, which takes
                input values from an html form, runs them through my python calculator program, stores the results in csv file,
                and finally displays the contents of the csv file in an html table.
                <br><br>
                The full project code can be found in this
                <a href="https://github.com/tanner666/calc_ex/tree/project_3" target="_blank" class="nounderline">link</a>
                to my github repo.

                At the top layer, the Calculator Class connects all the other classes. It has methods for all four calculations,
                such as add_numbers, that call upon the corresponding History Class methods. The History Class has four specific methods for the calculations,
                such as add_addition_calculation, which call upon a create method to instantiate the corresponding calculation object (like Addition), pass the object a tuple of
                values, and then store the calculation object in a list. The calculation object is instantiated and setup by the calculation factory class.<br>
                The Calculator Class can then ask for the result of that calculation, using the get_result_value() method, which
                calls another History Class method to retrieve the result. This History Class method looks at the list of calculation objects,
                calls upon the get_result() method of the corresponding calculation object (where the actual computation is performed),
                 and retrieves and returns this result. <br>
